# Contributing

Fork the repository to your personal Github account.

Now, open a terminal on your local machine and clone the forked repository by doing: git clone

For example: git clone https://github.com/Seungjusamlee/Opia-Os

Create a branch in git inside your local machine: git checkout -b

Now you can fix bugs or do whatever you need to do in order to improve the code in the project. Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.

If the project has tests run them! Write or adapt tests as needed. Add or change the documentation as needed. Remember to make sure the changes are applied only to the branch you created!

Open CONTRIBUTORS.md in a text editor and add your name to it. Don’t add it at the beginning or the end of the file, add it anywhere in the middle of it.

Now, save the file.

Commit those changes by doing git commit -m "Added to contributors list “-m” tells git that you are committing the changes with a message to tell people what the commit is about.

Push those changes to the forked repository on Github via: git push origin replacing “ with the name of the branch you created earlier.
